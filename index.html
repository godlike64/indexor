      A file and directory indexing tool.
    </div>

    <p>Welcome to Indexor, a program designed to keep track of where you left which things stored.

Indexor can currently scan a directory of your choosing, indexing all files and directories under it, and extracting metadata from media files (audio, video and image). Filters can be applied to the scanning process, and error messages are logged in a separate window, giving the possibility to save the error list to a plain text file. The resulting catalog can be saved into a plain text file or into a binary file. If saved to binary, such file can later be loaded into an Indexor instance (in less time than it took to scan the directory), and all data will be there.<br/><br/>

Indexor also features an info pane, inspired by the one present in the Dolphin file manager. When visible, displays all metadata it was able to extract from the currently selected file, plus a thumbnail for image files (the thumbnail is also displayed in the file list but at a smaller default size).<br/><br/>

While it theoretically CAN run under Windows, as long as you have all the dependencies (I personally ran it some time ago), as of now a Windows installer doesn't exist. I have plans to develop one, but never put much effort in them (e.g. develop the py2exe setup.py  and InnoSetup script, testing it, etc). Nevertheless, I intend to officially support Windows when most of the things I have planned for the app are finished :)<br/><br/>

Indexor is currently under development, so there are no guarantees: things may break or become incompatible, kitties may die and houses may be repossessed. Other than that, it's safe to use ;).

I developed it with the purpose of learning Python, and because the similar tools available did not satisfy me in some aspects, portability being one of them. Indexor's generated catalog binary files can be loaded on any Indexor instance, and I intend to keep it that way, despite format changes.

Since I do this in my free time (whenever I have some), I could really use a hand developing Indexor. If you are interested, please contact me.</p><h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Python-2.6 or newer
GTK+-2.16 or newer
PyGTK-2.14.1 or newer (and its suite of libraries: gobject, pango, etc.)
kaa-metadata (used for extracting metadata from media files)</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Currently there aren't any as I don't have a setup script or anything like that :P. Just make sure you have all the deps installed, and then run indexor.py from the directory where it is located. This last step is CRITICAL, as Indexor will not work if you don't follow it.</p>
